   * Base class for fluid flow problems (both single-phase and two-phase
   * problems) that implements boundary conditions and the basic steps of the
   * solution, setup, advance_one_time_step, and output). The actual action of
   * most of these is defined in derived classes.
   *
   * Boundary conditions are set at the beginning of the setup() function of the
   * individual fluid solvers using the stored internal boundary information. In
   * order for the program to recognize the conditions, they must be set before
   * the setup() call. The best way to impose the conditions is to do it as soon
   * as the triangulation is created. There is no need to re-impose boundary
   * conditions when the mesh is refined as boundary indicators do not change
   * (but you need to reset them when the boundary indicator changes, of
   * course).
   *
   * All of the set functions below are only allowed to be called
   * once. Otherwise, the conditions need to be cleared with this
   * clear_all_boundary_conditions() function.
   *
   * This class is a base class for all fluid classes and includes the standard
   * set of boundary conditions. It allows derived classes to use the methods
   * here as given or to override them when additional information is necessary,
   * e.g. in phase field methods where one might want to set the concentration
   * order function to a given value.
